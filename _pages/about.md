Hi there! I am Wenjie Du, an Associate Researcher at the School of Software Engineering/Suzhou Institute for Advanced Research, University of Science and Technology of China [USTC](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/), and a member of the [USTC-DILab](https://di.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm). I received my Ph.D. in the School of Software Engineering, USTC in 2024, supervised by Prof. Xike Xie and Prof. Yang Wang. Before starting my Ph.D. study, I received my Bachelor's degree from Northeastern University (NEU) in 2018. I have published about 20 high-level papers on research journals and conferences, including some top level international journals and conferences, such as Nature Water, Nature Communication, PNAS, JACS, ACL,IJCAI, IEEE TKDE, IEEE BIBM and so on. I am broadly interested in generalized AI for Science especially in the Environment, Chemistry and Materials science.

🌟Hiring: We are actively seeking funded visiting students, research assistant and self-motivated Ph.D. students. Since July 2022, almost every visiting student who worked with me has published papers at top conferences such as ICML, NeurIPS, and ICLR during their visit. If you are interested, please don't hesitate to contact me via [Email](duwenjie@mail.ustc.edu.cn).

News
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
